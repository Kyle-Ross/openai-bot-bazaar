-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Silent Counselor mimes unlocking an imaginary box and placing it on the imaginary table in front of Judge Grumpycakes.

Judge Grumpycakes: (annoyed) What's this?

Silent Counselor mimes unrolling the imaginary toilet paper and hands it over to Judge Grumpycakes.

Judge Grumpycakes: (exasperated) A toilet roll? Why am I looking at a toilet roll?

Silent Counselor mimes a thief stealing an imaginary toilet roll from a bathroom.

Judge Grumpycakes: (sighs) Oh, I get it. So, you're representing the defendant accused of stealing a toilet roll?

Silent Counselor nods and mimes defending the defendant.

Judge Grumpycakes: (sarcastically) This is a very important case, isn't it?

Silent Counselor mimes the importance of the case and the severity of the consequences.

Judge Grumpycakes: (in disbelief) You want me to believe that someone stole a single toilet roll and you're going to waste my time with this?

Silent Counselor mimes a plea to hear the case out and show that no matter how small the theft, it is still a crime.

Judge Grumpycakes: (sighs heavily) Fine, let's hear it. But I'm warning you, Counselor, this better not be a waste of my time.

Silent Counselor nods and begins to mime out their case, passionately arguing for the defendant's innocence.

Silent Counselor continues to passionately argue for the defendant's innocence, but Judge Grumpycakes seems increasingly agitated.

Judge Grumpycakes: (interrupting the mime) Alright, that's enough. I've heard enough.

Silent Counselor looks confused and tries to continue their argument, but Judge Grumpycakes cuts them off.

Judge Grumpycakes: (pointing an accusatory finger) You know what? I stole that toilet roll!

Silent Counselor stares at Judge Grumpycakes in amazement, but doesn't say a word.

Judge Grumpycakes: (defensively) It was a mistake! I needed it for my own personal use, and I didn't want to get caught taking a whole package. So, I just took one. I never meant to start all of this nonsense.

Silent Counselor continues to stare in disbelief, then mimes handing over the imaginary toilet roll back to Judge Grumpycakes.

Judge Grumpycakes: (chuckling nervously) Yes, thank you. I'll make sure it gets back where it belongs.

Silent Counselor mimes an idea, then imagines calling the police and pointing a finger at Judge Grumpycakes.

Judge Grumpycakes: (panicking) No, no, no! Please don't call the police. I'll do anything. Just don't ruin my reputation.

Silent Counselor mimes a negotiation, then imagines a deal made with Judge Grumpycakes. 

Judge Grumpycakes: (relieved) Alright, you have a deal. I'll let this case go, and I'll make sure justice is served from now on. 

Silent Counselor nods and mimes putting away the imaginary box, then exits the room.

Judge Grumpycakes takes a deep breath, then puts his head in his hands. He knows he got off easy, but he also knows that he can never steal anything again.
