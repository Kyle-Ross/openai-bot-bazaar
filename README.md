# openai-dialogue-generator

Interactive dialogue generator built using the OpenAI API via their python library.

## How to use

There are 3 ways:
1. Clone the repo and insert your api keys into the `secrets_placeholder.json` file using a text editor. Then rename the file to `secrets.json`.
2. Download the `dialogue_generator - key via json.exe` file, and repeat the steps above with the json file. Make sure it is in the same folder as the exe.
3. Download the `dialogue_generator - key via input.exe` file, and follow the prompts to enter your api keys when you run the exe.

## How it works
A step-by-step command line interface guides you through the process of generating character and starting a dialogue between them.

You describe the characters, and their names are generated by the AI. 

From there, you can leave it to the AI to choose a topic of discussion - or direct it to have the characters talk about something specific.

After each response from the AI, you can continue generating the dialogue with or without additional prompts.

When you are done, you can conveniently output the dialogue to a text file - see the example saved in the root folder.

## Other Notes
- Used models can be swapped in the code by changing the 'selected_model' variable
- Prompts are divided into building blocks which can be easily adjusted in the code to fine-tune the AI output
